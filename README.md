## Sinking Squids
"RED ALERT! ALL HANDS ON DECK!"
In this project, there are 3 groups of squids approaching. Can you find them all in this battleship inspired game?

## Installation

Add this to a new folder:
1. Fork & Clone
2. cd into that folder
3. Run Bundle Install 
4. Run rails s -p 3001(server) within the backend folder
5. run npm install, then npm start within the frontend folder

## Usage 
When the user opens the site, there is a greeting message and 4 links on the NavBar. Here is what each link does

HOME: This is what the website opens to and is the homepage of the site. You get this message when you get to this page "Press Play to start the game or Rules to see how to play!"

Play: When you open this page, you will be greeted with a 20x20 board. In the board, there are 3 groups of Squids hiding. The 3 groups are a small group that needs 2 shots, a medium group that needs 3 shots, and a large group that needs 4 shots. When you find them, the game is over! If you want to submit your score, there is a place to enter your initals and a button to send how many shots it took you.

Rules: Here is a little summary on how to play the game

Leaderboard: On this page, you will see the top 20 scores. Enter your initals after you complete your game to submit a score that could be on this list!
